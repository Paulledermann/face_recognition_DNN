# face_recognition_DNN
The aim of the project is to implement and study a face recognition system using a pre-trained model that encodes face images into 128-dimensional vectors. These vectors are produced by a neural network trained specifically for face recognition. By comparing these vectors, the system determines whether two images are of the same person.
